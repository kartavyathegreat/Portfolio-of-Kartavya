		<h4> Hello, I am Kartavya Gupta studying in 6th Grade at Oakridge International School, Bachupally. I live in NCL Godavari Homes near Sherwood Public School, Hyderabad. I love playing video games especially the ones in which we have to kill people, basically action games. I also have great interest in Coding, so I have joined WhiteHatJR. Now I am making this website with all the things which I have learnt with WhiteHatJR. Here's my picture.</h4> <img src="1234.jpg.jpg" </img> <br> <h4> I am 11 years old, younger brother of Gaurav Gupta (1st year Mechanical Engineering, Vingana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and technology,Bachupally) Son of Ashwani Gupta (Buisnees man, director of Urjas Airtec pvt.ltd, Kalakal, Hyderabad)Son of Anu Gupta (House Wife, Home Tutor).

Cycling is not only good for our health but also for our image (only in my apartment). We learn more about our cycle and the different features.</h4>
